###### Data Model
- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices Blog
- In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.
